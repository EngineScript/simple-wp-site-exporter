# Changelog for Simple WP Site Exporter

## Unreleased

### Scheduled Deletion System Enhancements

- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive debugging system with `error_log()` output for WordPress cron troubleshooting when standard debug logging is disabled
- **Dual Cleanup System**: Implemented redundant scheduled deletion with both individual file cleanup (5 minutes) and bulk directory cleanup (10 minutes) as safety net
- **Bulk Cleanup Handler**: Added `sse_bulk_cleanup_exports_handler()` to scan and clean all export files older than 5 minutes from the entire export directory
- **Improved Scheduling**: Enhanced `sse_schedule_export_cleanup()` with detailed logging, DISABLE_WP_CRON detection, and WordPress cron array status monitoring
- **Test Framework**: Added `sse_test_cron_scheduling()` function to verify WordPress cron functionality before attempting real scheduling
- **Cron Diagnostics**: Implemented `sse_get_scheduled_deletions()` for debugging scheduled events and cron system status
- **Verification System**: Added post-scheduling verification to confirm events are properly added to WordPress cron schedule

### Bug Fixes

- **Scheduled Deletion**: Resolved issue where export files were not being automatically deleted due to WordPress cron scheduling failures
- **Fallback System**: Removed unnecessary fallback methods as requested, streamlining the system to use only WordPress cron
- **Error Logging**: Improved error visibility by adding direct `error_log()` output for cron debugging when WordPress debug settings are disabled
- **Export Directory Consistency**: Centralized export directory naming via `SSE_EXPORT_DIR_NAME` constant to eliminate mismatched cleanup paths and ensure all subsystems reference the same location
- **Filesystem Validation**: Added explicit directory creation and writability checks with helpful error messaging when the exports folder can't be prepared

## 1.9.0 - August 23, 2025

### Performance Enhancements (1.9.0)

- **Export Locking**: Implemented a lock using transients (`sse_export_lock`) to prevent concurrent export processes and reduce server load.
- **User-Configurable File Size Limits**: Added a user-friendly dropdown in the export form to exclude files larger than selected sizes (100MB, 500MB, 1GB, or no limit).

### Code Quality Improvements (1.9.0)

- **Centralized Configuration**: Created `SSE_ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` constant to eliminate code duplication for file extension validation.
- **Unified Validation**: Consolidated file extension validation logic into a single reusable function.

### User Experience Improvements (1.9.0)

- **Enhanced Export Form**: Added intuitive file size limit selection directly in the export interface, eliminating the need for developers to write custom filter code.

### Security Hardening (1.9.0)

- **WP-CLI Verification**: Added executable/existence verification for PATH-discovered WP-CLI binary
- **Error Output Sanitization**: Sanitized WP-CLI failure output (path masking, line limiting) to prevent filesystem disclosure
- **Graceful Scheduled Deletion**: Treats missing file during scheduled cleanup as info (likely already removed) instead of error
- **Conditional Root Flag**: Added conditional inclusion of `--allow-root` only when actually running as root
- **Strict Download Validation**: Hardened download file data validation (type checks, required keys, numeric size enforcement)
- **Secure File Data Handling**: Added stronger sanitization and non-positive size rejection before serving downloads

## 1.8.4 - August 7, 2025

### Code Quality Improvements (1.8.4)

- **WordPress Coding Standards**: Comprehensive PHPCS compliance fixes across all functions
  - Fixed function documentation block spacing and alignment
  - Standardized parameter formatting with proper spacing (e.g., `function( $param )`)
  - Corrected Yoda conditions for all boolean comparisons (e.g., `false === $variable`)
  - Aligned array formatting with consistent spacing (e.g., `'key' => 'value'`)
  - Fixed multi-line function call formatting and indentation
  - Resolved all remaining WordPress coding standards violations
- **Code Consistency**: Enhanced code readability and maintainability through standardized formatting

### Bug Fixes (1.8.4)

- **Scheduled Deletion**: Resolved issue where export files were not being automatically deleted due to WordPress cron scheduling failures

- **Error Logging**: Improved error visibility by adding direct `error_log()` output for cron debugging when WordPress debug settings are disabled

## 1.8.3 - August 2, 2025

### WordPress Plugin Directory Compliance (1.8.3)

- **Text Domain Fix**: Updated text domain from 'Simple-WP-Site-Exporter' to 'simple-wp-site-exporter' (lowercase) to comply with WordPress.org plugin directory requirements
- **Load Textdomain Removal**: Removed discouraged `load_plugin_textdomain()` function call as WordPress automatically handles translations for plugins hosted on WordPress.org since version 4.6
- **Plugin Header Update**: Fixed "Text Domain" header to use only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens as required by WordPress standards

### Security Fix (1.8.3)

- **Critical Security Fix**: Resolved a fatal error caused by a missing `sse_get_safe_wp_cli_path()` function. This function is essential for securely locating the WP-CLI executable, and its absence prevented the database export process from running. The new function ensures that the plugin can reliably find WP-CLI in common locations, allowing the export to proceed as intended.

## 1.8.1 - July 11, 2025

### Documentation Workflow Updates (1.8.1)

- **Version Control**: Removed `changelog.txt` file to streamline documentation; maintaining only `readme.txt` (WordPress.org) and `CHANGELOG.md` (for developers).
