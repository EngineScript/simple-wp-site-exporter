# Changelog for EngineScript Site Exporter

## Unreleased

### Security

- **Export Directory Protection**: Added `.htaccess` file to the export directory with `Deny from all` rules (Apache 2.2 and 2.4) to prevent direct HTTP access to export files during the cleanup window. Previously only an `index.php` prevented directory listing.
- **Private API Removal**: Removed usage of `_get_cron_array()` (WordPress private/internal function) from cron failure diagnostics. Uses only public APIs (`wp_next_scheduled()`, `wp_schedule_single_event()`) now.
- **Filesystem Compatibility**: Replaced `glob()` with `scandir()` in `sse_bulk_cleanup_exports_handler()` for cross-platform compatibility and consistency with WordPress filesystem conventions.
- **SSRF Hardening**: File download functions now use `realpath()`-resolved paths for all filesystem operations (`readfile()`, `is_readable()`, `is_file()`), preventing TOCTOU and SSRF attack vectors. `sse_validate_file_output_security()` now returns the resolved path for direct use.
- **CSP Compliance**: Replaced inline `onclick` JavaScript handler with external `js/admin.js` file to comply with Content Security Policy headers and prevent inline script execution risks.
- **Upload Directory Validation**: Added `wp_upload_dir()` error key check alongside the existing `basedir` empty check, preventing silent failures on misconfigured hosts.
- **Scheduled Cleanup Hardening**: Scheduled export deletion now deletes only the validated export directory path rather than the raw cron argument.
- **Symlink Export Hardening**: WordPress file archive creation now skips symbolic links and verifies resolved paths stay within the WordPress root before adding them.
- **WP-CLI Path Hardening**: Removed PATH lookup for WP-CLI and now only executes WP-CLI from explicit allowed locations.
- **Download Boundary Hardening**: Final download path validation now uses normalized trailing-slash directory containment checks.
- **Destructive Action Hardening**: Manual export deletion now uses POST with nonce verification instead of a GET link.
- **Extension Policy Tightening**: Export download validation now allows only `.zip` files.

### Bug Fixes

- **Documentation Fix**: Corrected README.md Security Features section from "after 1 hour" to "after 5 minutes" to match actual cleanup timer.
- **Unused Variable**: Removed unused `$export_dir_name` variable assignment in `sse_exporter_page_html()`.
- **phpcs Suppression**: Removed unnecessary `phpcs:ignore WordPress.Security.EscapeOutput.OutputNotEscaped` comment on a line already properly escaped with `esc_html()`.
- **GEMINI.md Accuracy**: Updated WP-CLI Integration section to reflect that WP-CLI is a required dependency (returns `WP_Error` if unavailable), replacing outdated "graceful fallback" language.
- **WP-CLI Language**: Updated README.md and readme.txt from "when available" to "Requires WP-CLI" to match v2.0.0 behavior.

### Architecture

- **EngineScript Archive Format**: Updated exports to match the canonical EngineScript combined site archive: outer ZIP named `<site>_enginescript_site_export_<timestamp>.zip`, root `manifest.txt`, `database/<site>_db_<timestamp>.sql.gz`, and `files/<site>_files_<timestamp>.tar.gz`.
- **File Splitting**: Split monolithic `enginescript-site-exporter.php` (~1,400 lines) into a 112-line bootstrap file plus 7 focused include files under `includes/`: `helpers.php`, `security.php`, `admin-page.php`, `export.php`, `archive.php`, `cleanup.php`, `download.php`. Each file is guarded by `ABSPATH` check.
- **Plugin File Constant**: Added `SSE_PLUGIN_FILE` constant defined as `__FILE__` in bootstrap, used by `includes/admin-page.php` for `plugin_dir_url()` calls since `__FILE__` resolves to the include path, not the plugin root.
- **Filter Name Constant**: Replaced hardcoded `'sse_max_file_size_for_export'` filter name string with `SSE_FILTER_MAX_FILE_SIZE` constant for discoverability.
- **Shell Output Sanitization**: Added `sanitize_text_field()` to WP-CLI error output in `sse_export_database()` for defense-in-depth.
- **Explicit Null Return**: Added explicit `return null;` to `sse_process_file_for_tar()` to match PHPDoc return type `true|null`.
- **RuntimeException Catch**: Changed `sse_add_wordpress_files_to_tar()` to catch `RuntimeException` specifically before generic `Exception` fallback.
- **DirectoryIterator**: Replaced `scandir()` with `DirectoryIterator` in `sse_bulk_cleanup_exports_handler()` for more efficient file iteration.
- **PHPStan Level Increase**: Increased PHPStan analysis level from 5 to 6, added `includes/` directory to scan paths.
- **Inline CSS Removal**: Extracted 7 inline `style` attributes from admin page and success notice into dedicated `css/admin.css` file with semantic CSS classes (`sse-section-spacing`, `sse-form-table`, `sse-warning-text`, `sse-action-button`).
- **Inline JS Removal**: Extracted inline `onclick` confirmation dialog into dedicated `js/admin.js` file with `sse-confirm-delete` class-based event listener.
- **Asset Enqueueing**: Added `sse_enqueue_admin_assets()` function hooked to `admin_enqueue_scripts` with page-slug check (`tools_page_enginescript-site-exporter`) to load CSS/JS only on the plugin's admin page. Uses `wp_localize_script()` for i18n of JavaScript confirmation string.
- **Copilot Instructions Revision**: Rewrote `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to remove irrelevant references (WooCommerce, package.json, admin.php), consolidate redundant security subsections, add plugin-specific naming conventions (`sse_`, `SSE_`), and fix version file list.

- **WP_Filesystem Helper**: Extracted duplicated `WP_Filesystem` initialization from 4 functions into a single `sse_init_filesystem()` helper that returns `true|WP_Error`, reducing ~40 lines of duplicated code to ~10.
- **Removed Wrapper Functions**: Inlined 3 pass-through wrapper functions (`sse_validate_download_request()`, `sse_validate_file_deletion()`, `sse_validate_export_file_for_deletion()`) — callers now invoke the underlying functions directly.
- **Download Validation Consolidation**: Removed 2 redundant intermediate validation passes (`sse_validate_download_file_data()`, `sse_validate_download_file_access()`) from the download flow. Entry validation and final `readfile()` security gate remain; intermediate re-validation of already-validated data removed.
- **Path Resolution Consolidation**: Consolidated 7-function-deep path resolution chain into a single `sse_resolve_file_path()` function. Removed 6 single-use intermediary functions (`sse_resolve_nonexistent_file_path()`, `sse_get_upload_directory_info()`, `sse_build_validated_file_path()`, `sse_validate_parent_directory_safety()`, `sse_construct_final_file_path()`, `sse_resolve_parent_directory()`, `sse_sanitize_filename()`).
- **Dead Code Removal**: Removed no-op `sse_prepare_execution_environment()` function and its call from the export flow.
- **Debug Code Removal**: Removed `sse_test_cron_scheduling()` debug function that created/verified/removed a test cron event on every export — no longer needed after v2.0.0 cron fixes.
- **Cron Logging Reduction**: Reduced cron scheduling functions from 5+ log entries each to 2 (success/failure), keeping `DISABLE_WP_CRON` diagnostic on failure only.

### PHP 7.4 Modernization

- **Type Declarations**: Added PHP 7.4 parameter types and return types to all functions where deterministic. Functions returning union types (`array|WP_Error`, `string|false`, `true|WP_Error`) retain PHPDoc-only annotations since PHP 7.4 does not support union return types.
- **Short Array Syntax**: Standardized all `array()` constructor calls to short `[]` syntax throughout the plugin.
- **Null Coalescing Assignment**: Replaced explicit null check + assignment pattern with PHP 7.4 `??=` operator in `sse_should_exclude_file()` file size cache, and `?:` Elvis operator for the ternary fallback.
- **PHPStan Array Shapes**: Added PHPStan `array{}` shape annotations to all functions accepting or returning associative arrays, resolving 10 level-6 "no value type specified in iterable type array" errors.
- **Trailing Whitespace**: Removed trailing whitespace (tabs on blank lines) across `export.php`, `download.php`, `cleanup.php`, `admin-page.php`, and `security.php`.
- **JS File Header**: Converted `admin.js` file header from JSDoc (`/** @package`, `@since`) to plain block comment to avoid TSDoc linter false positives.
- **Bulk Cleanup Complexity**: Extracted per-file deletion logic from `sse_bulk_cleanup_exports_handler()` into `sse_cleanup_expired_export_file()` helper, reducing cyclomatic complexity from 13 to 8 and NPath complexity from 336 to under 200.
- **PHPStan Array Shape**: Added `array{filepath: string, filename: string}` shape annotation to `sse_validate_export_file_path()` return type in `security.php`, resolving level-6 error.
- **PHPStan Ignore Cleanup**: Removed three obsolete `ignoreErrors` patterns from `phpstan.neon` (`$post`, `$wp_query`, `$wpdb`) that are now resolved by the WordPress stubs.

## 2.0.0 - March 1, 2026

### Critical Bug Fixes

- **Scheduled Deletion Fix**: Fixed critical bug where automatic export file cleanup via WordPress cron was completely broken. The referer validation in `sse_validate_basic_export_file()` was blocking all cron-triggered deletions since scheduled tasks have no HTTP referer. Referer checks are now correctly applied only to user-facing download and deletion handlers.
- **Deletion Notice Fix**: Fixed bug where success/failure notices after manually deleting an export file were lost due to `add_action('admin_notices')` being registered before `wp_safe_redirect()` + `exit`. Notices are now passed via query parameter and displayed on the redirected page.

### Security & Escaping Fixes

- **Double Escaping Prevention**: Fixed 9 instances of double-escaped WP_Error messages where `esc_html__()` was used in error construction but messages were escaped again with `esc_html()` at output time. Changed to `__()` in WP_Error constructors since escaping belongs at the output boundary.
- **Admin Menu Escaping**: Removed redundant `esc_html__()` in `sse_admin_menu()` — WordPress core already escapes page and menu titles internally.
- **Submit Button Escaping**: Removed redundant `esc_html__()` in `submit_button()` call — the function internally applies `esc_attr()` to button text.
- **Database Export Error**: Removed pre-escaping of WP-CLI error output in `sse_export_database()` WP_Error to prevent double escaping when displayed via `sse_show_error_notice()`.
- **Symlink Compatibility**: Removed overly strict `realpath()` equality check in `sse_validate_download_file_access()` that could block valid downloads on servers with symlinked upload directories. Directory containment validation already provides equivalent security.

### Performance Improvements

- **File Size Filter Caching**: Cached the `sse_max_file_size_for_export` filter result using a static variable in `sse_should_exclude_file()` to avoid redundant `get_transient()`, `get_current_user_id()`, and `apply_filters()` calls for every file during export.
- **Error Log Autoload**: Added `false` autoload parameter to `update_option()` in `sse_store_log_in_database()` to prevent debug logs from being loaded into memory on every WordPress page request.

### Code Quality

- **Dead Code Removal**: Removed unused `sse_get_scheduled_deletions()` debugging function that was never called from any code path.
- **Shell Safety**: Added `function_exists('shell_exec')` check in `sse_get_safe_wp_cli_path()` before attempting PATH lookup, preventing PHP warnings when `shell_exec` is disabled.
- **POT File Cleanup**: Removed 6 stale translation entries referencing functions that no longer exist. Added missing translatable strings for file size options, error messages, and WP-CLI status messages.
- **GEMINI.md**: Updated version reference from 1.8.4 to 1.9.1.

## 1.9.1 - September 29, 2025

- **Verification System**: Added post-scheduling verification to confirm events are properly added to WordPress cron schedule

### Code Quality Improvements

- **WordPress VIP Compliance**: Replaced direct PHP filesystem function `is_writable()` with WordPress Filesystem API (`WP_Filesystem`) for VIP coding standards compliance
- **Filesystem API Integration**: Added proper WordPress filesystem initialization with error handling in export preparation function
- **Code Style**: Fixed variable alignment inconsistencies in `sse_test_cron_scheduling()` function to maintain consistent spacing standards

### Bug Fixes

- **Scheduled Deletion**: Resolved issue where export files were not being automatically deleted due to WordPress cron scheduling failures
- **Fallback System**: Removed unnecessary fallback methods as requested, streamlining the system to use only WordPress cron
- **Error Logging**: Improved error visibility by adding direct `error_log()` output for cron debugging when WordPress debug settings are disabled
- **Export Directory Consistency**: Centralized export directory naming via `SSE_EXPORT_DIR_NAME` constant to eliminate mismatched cleanup paths and ensure all subsystems reference the same location
- **Filesystem Validation**: Added explicit directory creation and writability checks with helpful error messaging when the exports folder can't be prepared
- **CI Database Service**: Replaced the GitHub Actions MySQL 5.7 test container with MariaDB 10.6 to avoid Docker Hub authentication failures while maintaining WordPress compatibility coverage

## 1.9.0 - August 23, 2025

### Performance Enhancements (1.9.0)

- **Export Locking**: Implemented a lock using transients (`sse_export_lock`) to prevent concurrent export processes and reduce server load.

- **Conditional Root Flag**: Added conditional inclusion of `--allow-root` only when actually running as root
- **Strict Download Validation**: Hardened download file data validation (type checks, required keys, numeric size enforcement)
- **Secure File Data Handling**: Added stronger sanitization and non-positive size rejection before serving downloads

## 1.8.4 - August 7, 2025

### Code Quality Improvements (1.8.4)

- **Plugin Header Update**: Fixed "Text Domain" header to use only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens as required by WordPress standards

### Security Fix (1.8.3)

- **Critical Security Fix**: Resolved a fatal error caused by a missing `sse_get_safe_wp_cli_path()` function. This function is essential for securely locating the WP-CLI executable, and its absence prevented the database export process from running. The new function ensures that the plugin can reliably find WP-CLI in common locations, allowing the export to proceed as intended.

## 1.8.1 - July 11, 2025

### Documentation Workflow Updates (1.8.1)
