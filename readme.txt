== Description ==

Simple WP Site Exporter provides WordPress administrators with a straightforward, secure way to export their entire website. With a single click, you can create a complete backup of your site's files and database, perfect for site migrations, backups, or local development environments.

Key features:
* One-Click Export: Create a complete site backup with just one click
* Database Export: Includes a full database dump in your export
* Automatic Cleanup: Exports are automatically deleted after 5 minutes to enhance security
* Secure Downloads: All exports use WordPress security tokens for protected access
* WP-CLI Integration: Leverages WP-CLI for efficient database exports when available
* Export Management: Download or manually delete export files as needed
* EngineScript Integration: Natively works with EngineScript's LEMP server environment and site import tools

This plugin is designed to work seamlessly with the EngineScript LEMP server environment:

* Native Integration: Automatically detected and configured when running on an EngineScript server
* Compatible Exports: All exports created with this plugin are directly compatible with EngineScript's site import tools
* Streamlined Migrations: Export from any WordPress site and import directly to an EngineScript-powered server
* Optimized Performance: When used on an EngineScript server, the plugin leverages server-optimized settings

The export format is specifically designed to work with EngineScript's site import functionality, allowing for seamless site migrations between WordPress installations.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/simple-wp-site-exporter` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Navigate to Tools → Site Exporter in your WordPress admin.
4. Click the "Export Site" button to create a full site backup.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How large of a site can I export? =

The plugin is designed to work with most WordPress sites, but very large sites (multiple GB) may encounter timeout or memory limitations depending on your hosting environment.

= Where are the export files stored? =

Exports are stored in your WordPress uploads directory, specifically at:
`[wp-root]/wp-content/uploads/simple-wp-site-exporter-exports/`

= Why do export files disappear after 5 minutes? =

For security and disk space considerations, all exports are automatically deleted after 5 minutes. This ensures sensitive site data isn't left stored indefinitely.

= Can I create multiple exports? =

Yes, you can create as many exports as needed. Each will have a unique filename based on the timestamp of creation.

= Does this include my themes and plugins? =

Yes, the export includes your entire WordPress installation: themes, plugins, uploads, and the complete database.

= Can I use this plugin with non-EngineScript servers? =

Absolutely! While the plugin integrates seamlessly with EngineScript servers, it works perfectly on any WordPress installation regardless of the server environment.

= Will this work on shared hosting environments? =

Yes, the plugin is designed to be compatible with most shared hosting environments. However, large sites may encounter timeout or memory limitations on restrictive hosting plans.
