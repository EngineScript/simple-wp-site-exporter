== Description ==

Simple WP Site Exporter provides WordPress administrators with a straightforward, secure way to export their entire website. With a single click, you can create a complete backup of your site's files and database, perfect for site migrations, backups, or local development environments.

Key features:
* One-Click Export: Create a complete site backup with just one click
* Database Export: Includes a full database dump in your export
* Automatic Cleanup: Exports are automatically deleted after 5 minutes to enhance security
* Secure Downloads: All exports use WordPress security tokens for protected access
* WP-CLI Integration: Leverages WP-CLI for efficient database exports when available
* Export Management: Download or manually delete export files as needed
* EngineScript Integration: Natively works with EngineScript's LEMP server environment and site import tools

This plugin is designed to work seamlessly with the EngineScript LEMP server environment:

* Native Integration: Automatically detected and configured when running on an EngineScript server
* Compatible Exports: All exports created with this plugin are directly compatible with EngineScript's site import tools
* Streamlined Migrations: Export from any WordPress site and import directly to an EngineScript-powered server
* Optimized Performance: When used on an EngineScript server, the plugin leverages server-optimized settings

The export format is specifically designed to work with EngineScript's site import functionality, allowing for seamless site migrations between WordPress installations.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/simple-wp-site-exporter` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Navigate to Tools â†’ Site Exporter in your WordPress admin.
4. Click the "Export Site" button to create a full site backup.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How large of a site can I export? =

The plugin is designed to work with most WordPress sites, but very large sites (multiple GB) may encounter timeout or memory limitations depending on your hosting environment.

= Where are the export files stored? =

Exports are stored in your WordPress uploads directory, specifically at:
`[wp-root]/wp-content/uploads/simple-wp-site-exporter-exports/`

= Why do export files disappear after 5 minutes? =

For security and disk space considerations, all exports are automatically deleted after 5 minutes. This ensures sensitive site data isn't left stored indefinitely.

= Can I create multiple exports? =

Yes, you can create as many exports as needed. Each will have a unique filename based on the timestamp of creation.

= Does this include my themes and plugins? =

Yes, the export includes your entire WordPress installation: themes, plugins, uploads, and the complete database.

= Can I use this plugin with non-EngineScript servers? =

Absolutely! While the plugin integrates seamlessly with EngineScript servers, it works perfectly on any WordPress installation regardless of the server environment.

= Will this work on shared hosting environments? =

Yes, the plugin is designed to be compatible with most shared hosting environments. However, large sites may encounter timeout or memory limitations on restrictive hosting plans.

* **Bug Fixes**: Resolved issue where export files were not being automatically deleted due to WordPress cron scheduling failures
* **Export Directory Consistency**: Centralized export directory naming with a shared constant so every cleanup routine targets the correct path
* **Filesystem Validation**: Added explicit directory creation and writability checks that surface actionable errors when the exports folder cannot be prepared
* **Code Quality**: Enhanced overall code readability and maintainability through standardized formatting and compliance improvements

= 1.8.5 =

= 1.8.4 =
* **WordPress Coding Standards**: Comprehensive PHPCS compliance fixes across all functions
* **Code Quality**: Fixed function documentation block spacing and alignment
* **Parameter Formatting**: Standardized parameter formatting with proper spacing (e.g., `function( $param )`)
* **Yoda Conditions**: Corrected Yoda conditions for all boolean comparisons (e.g., `false === $variable`)
* **Array Formatting**: Aligned array formatting with consistent spacing (e.g., `'key' => 'value'`)
* **Multi-line Functions**: Fixed multi-line function call formatting and indentation
