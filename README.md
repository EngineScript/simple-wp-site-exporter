## Frequently Asked Questions

### How large of a site can I export?

The plugin is designed to work with most WordPress sites, but very large sites (multiple GB) may encounter timeout or memory limitations depending on your hosting environment.

### Where are the export files stored?

Exports are stored in your WordPress uploads directory, specifically at:
`[wp-root]/wp-content/uploads/simple-wp-site-exporter-exports/`

### Why do export files disappear after 5 minutes?

For security and disk space considerations, all exports are automatically deleted after 5 minutes. This ensures sensitive site data isn't left stored indefinitely.

### Can I create multiple exports?

Yes, you can create as many exports as needed. Each will have a unique filename based on the timestamp of creation.

### Does this include my themes and plugins?

Yes, the export includes your entire WordPress installation: themes, plugins, uploads, and the complete database.

### Can I use this plugin with non-EngineScript servers?

Absolutely! While the plugin integrates seamlessly with EngineScript servers, it works perfectly on any WordPress installation regardless of the server environment.
